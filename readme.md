# Birthday Moments Recorder

A web application for parents to collect and preserve special memories for their children from age 0 to 18, which will be assembled into a digital and physical time capsule.

## How It Works

1. **Access Control**: The main application is only accessible after visiting the timemachine.md page (represented by timemachine.html in this implementation).

2. **Child Profile**: Parents can create a profile for their child with name and birthdate information.

3. **Annual Entries**: For each year from 0 to 18, parents can add:
   - Photos and videos
   - Notes about milestones and special moments
   - A personal letter to their child

4. **Time Capsule**: All entries are compiled into a digital time capsule, with optional physical printing at the end of the journey.

## Setup Instructions

1. Simply open `timemachine.html` in your browser
2. Click the "Enter Birthday Moments Recorder" button
3. You will be redirected to the main application

## Technical Implementation

This implementation uses:
- HTML5, CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS), and vanilla JavaScript
- Local storage for data persistence (in a production environment, this would use a database)
- A responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices

## Features

- Child profile creation
- Media upload and preview
- Year-by-year timeline visualization
